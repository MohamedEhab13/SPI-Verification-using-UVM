This project verifies an SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) design using the **Universal Verification Methodology (UVM)**. The verification environment ensures the correctness and robustness of the SPI protocol implementation under various conditions, including edge cases, timing issues, and protocol compliance.

## Features of the Verification Environment
- **UVM Testbench**:
  - Driver, monitor, and scoreboard components to simulate and analyze SPI transactions.
  - Configurable sequences for generating different types of SPI traffic.
- **Coverage-Driven Verification**:
  - Functional and code coverage metrics to ensure thorough testing.
- **Assertions**:
  - SystemVerilog assertions for validating SPI protocol compliance, such as clock phase and polarity (CPOL and CPHA), and transaction timing.
- **Error Injection**:
  - Verification of the SPI's behavior under fault conditions, such as bit flips and invalid commands.

## Supported SPI Features
- **Modes**: Full-duplex and half-duplex communication.
- **Clock Configurations**: Configurable CPOL and CPHA.
- **Data Widths**: Support for multiple data sizes.
- **Master and Slave Modes**: Verification of both SPI master and slave functionalities.

## Test Plan
1. **Functional Verification**:
   - Validate the proper functioning of SPI read and write operations.
   - Ensure compatibility with different clock configurations and data widths.
2. **Protocol Compliance**:
   - Verify timing requirements and adherence to SPI standards.
3. **Stress Testing**:
   - Simulate high-frequency transactions and long burst transfers.
4. **Fault Injection**:
   - Test the system's robustness under unexpected conditions.
5. **Coverage Analysis**:
   - Ensure that all corner cases and protocol scenarios are tested.
